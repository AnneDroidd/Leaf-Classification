# Leaf-Classification
Leaf Classification using CNN and SVM
### Order of work flow as follows:
1. [Preprocessing 1 image](https://github.com/AnneDroidd/Leaf-Classification/blob/main/Preprocessing_1_image.ipynb)
2. [Preprocessing the entire dataset](https://github.com/AnneDroidd/Leaf-Classification/blob/main/Preprocessing_entire_dataset.ipynb)
3. [Classifying Leaves by Species using SVM](https://github.com/AnneDroidd/Leaf-Classification/blob/main/SVM_Classifier.ipynb)
4. [Classifying Leaves by Species using CNN](https://github.com/AnneDroidd/Leaf-Classification/blob/main/CNN_Leaf.ipynb)

### Note:
- For SVM, the Flavia dataset was used as is
- For CNN, the Flavia dataset was arranged in sub folders, named after the species each image belongs to
